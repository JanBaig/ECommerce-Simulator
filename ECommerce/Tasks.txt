TASKS:
- (DONE) Basic: actions CUSTS, BOOKS, ORDERS, SHIPPED
- (DONE) Intermediate: actions ORDER, SHIP, CUSTORDERS, NEWCUST, CANCEL
- (CURRENTLY) SORTBYNAME, SORTBYPRICE, SORTBYCUST

EXPLANATIONS:
- Need to igore the '\n' in cin after hitting enter after 'NEWCUST'. getline() terminates with a '\n'
  cin >> reads the newline char but does not include it inside the var. getline() on the other hand, 
  does not include it but if found already in stream, terminates 
- Putting a base class and a derived class into a vector of type <base> does not allow for 
  Polymorphism. Instead, the type of the vector should be <base*> 
- Check disc account for information on assigning things to a pointer (Using the new keyword)  

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Optimize arrays using smart pointers
- Decrement the stock count as well
- Each class should have an order method which polymorphically orders items 
	- If the item is a book, it automatically asks for the options, else it does not
- Why can't the comparator method be apart of any class? Like ECommerce
