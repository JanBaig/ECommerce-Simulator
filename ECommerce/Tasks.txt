TASKS:

- Advanced: Action ORDERBOOK and class Book functionality
- Advanced: action ORDERSHOES and class Shoes
- 3 SORT actions (see code) 
- BooksByAuthor action implemented


EXPLANATIONS:
- Need to igore the '\n' in cin after hitting enter after 'NEWCUST'. getline() terminates with a '\n'
  cin >> reads the newline char but does not include it inside the var. getline() on the other hand, does not include it but if found already in stream, terminates 
- Putting a base class and a derived class into a vector of type <base> does not allow for 
  Polymorphism. Instead, the type of the vector should be <base*> 
- Check disc account for information on assigning things to a pointer (Using the new keyword)  


IMPROVEMENTS:
- Optimize arrays using smart pointers (Make dummy programs first and test those - otherwise errors will explode)
