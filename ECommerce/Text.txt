TASKS:
- (DONE) How to read the entire line of input without reading the other 'std::cout's ?
- Work on the Customer class


EXPLANATIONS:
- Need to igore the '\n' in cin after hitting enter after 'NEWCUST'. getline() terminates with a '\n'
  cin >> reads the newline char but does not include it inside the var. getline() on the other hand, does not include it but if found already in stream, terminates
